# Shell Reserve Implementation

**Shell (XSL) - Digital Gold for Central Banks**

This repository contains the **work-in-progress** reference implementation of Shell Reserve, a cryptocurrency designed exclusively as a reserve asset for central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and large financial institutions.

## 🎯 Vision

Shell Reserve is "digital gold" for the 21st century - designed to be boring, reliable, and built to last. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that try to do everything, Shell has one singular focus: **store value securely for decades**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shell implements a minimal three-layer design with essential institutional features:

- **L0: Base Consensus Layer** - RandomX PoW, UTXO model, Confidential Transactions
- **L0.7: Basic Custody Layer** - Standard multisig, time locks, Taproot  
- **L1: Institutional Settlement** - Bilateral channels, claimable balances, document hashes, ISO 20022

**Simple primitives. Essential features. Institutional focus.**

- ❌ `liquidity/attestor.go` - Multi-attestor validation system  
- ❌ `liquidity/reward.go` - Liquidity reward program
- ❌ `test/phase_b_integration_test.go` - Integration tests
- ❌ `PHASE_B_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation

### ✅ **2. Advanced Vault Covenants** - REMOVED
**Deleted**: `covenants/vault/` package (1500+ lines of code)
- ❌ `covenants/vault/enhanced_vault.go` - Complex custody policies
- ❌ `covenants/vault/vault.go` - Basic vault implementation
- ❌ `covenants/vault/enhanced_vault_test.go` - Test suite
- ❌ OP_VAULTTEMPLATEVERIFY opcode from `txscript/opcode.go`
- ❌ Vault integration from `txscript/taproot_shell.go`

### ✅ **3. MuSig2 Aggregated Signatures** - REMOVED
**Deleted**: `crypto/musig2/` package (800+ lines of code)

- ❌ `crypto/musig2/musig2_test.go` - Test suite

**🎯 RESULT: Successfully simplified the codebase by removing ~4,300 lines of complex institutional features that weren't in the official plans. The remaining implementation now better aligns with the "minimal design" and "boring by design" philosophy.**

---

**🔍 IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS SUMMARY:**
- **UNDERSTATED**: Bilateral channels and claimable balances are more complete than claimed
- **MISSING**: Document hashes are not actually implemented despite being marked completed  
- **PLANNING ONLY**: ISO 20022 integration exists only in planning documents
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Successfully removed ~4,300 lines of extra features to align with minimal design goals
- **READY FOR LAUNCH**: Genesis block and core blockchain appear production-ready
