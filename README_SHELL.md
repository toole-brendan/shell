# Shell Reserve Implementation

**Shell (XSL) - Digital Gold for Central Banks**

This repository contains the **work-in-progress** reference implementation of Shell Reserve, a cryptocurrency designed exclusively as a reserve asset for central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and large financial institutions.

## üéØ Vision

Shell Reserve is "digital gold" for the 21st century - designed to be boring, reliable, and built to last. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that try to do everything, Shell has one singular focus: **store value securely for decades**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Shell implements a layered design that separates concerns:

- **L0: Base Consensus Layer** - RandomX PoW, Confidential Transactions, UTXO model
- **L0.5: Privacy Layer** (Future) - Ring signatures, stealth addresses  
- **L0.7: Custody Layer** - MuSig2, Vault covenants, Taproot
- **L1: Settlement Layer** - Payment channels, claimable balances, atomic swaps

This is the **Phase Œ± (Core Chain)** implementation - **PHASE Œ± COMPLETE!**
