# Shell Reserve Implementation

**Shell (XSL) - Digital Gold for Central Banks**

This repository contains the **work-in-progress** reference implementation of Shell Reserve, a cryptocurrency designed exclusively as a reserve asset for central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and large financial institutions.

## 🎯 Vision

Shell Reserve is "digital gold" for the 21st century - designed to be boring, reliable, and built to last. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that try to do everything, Shell has one singular focus: **store value securely for decades**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shell implements a minimal three-layer design with essential institutional features:

- **L0: Base Consensus Layer** - RandomX PoW, UTXO model, Confidential Transactions
- **L0.7: Basic Custody Layer** - Standard multisig, time locks, Taproot  
- **L1: Institutional Settlement** - Bilateral channels, claimable balances, document hashes, ISO 20022

**Simple primitives. Essential features. Institutional focus.**

## 🛡️ Design Principles

### **What Shell HAS:**
- ✅ Simple PoW consensus
- ✅ Hidden amounts (CT)
- ✅ Basic multisig
- ✅ Time locks
- ✅ Claimable balances (Stellar-style)
- ✅ Document hashes (no attestors)
- ✅ ISO 20022 compatibility
- ✅ Bilateral channels
- ✅ Atomic swaps

### **What Shell DOESN'T Have:**
- ❌ No finality gadget
- ❌ No complex covenants

## 🏛️ Why These Features?

The included features directly serve institutional needs:

1. **Claimable Balances**: Enable escrow and conditional payments essential for cross-border settlements
2. **Document Hashes**: Provide audit trails without introducing trust assumptions
3. **ISO 20022**: Seamless integration with existing SWIFT infrastructure
4. **Bilateral Channels**: Efficient settlement between known institutions

These aren't "extra" features—they're the minimum viable set for a true institutional reserve asset.
